</h2> 

I’m a Senior Software Engineer with a long experience in designing, implementing, and releasing successful web applications.  

I worked across a wide range of business domains, including small companies, well-known enterprise corporations, and startups, driving cross-functional teams to adopt best practices, optimize performances, and deliver innovative solutions that meet both user and business needs.  

Passionate about:

- DevOps culture
- TDD, Extreme Programming
- Node.JS, Typescript, and Web technologies

I’m also a creative guy, and during my free time, I like painting graffiti and canvases 🎨, drawing ✏️, and taking pictures with my camera 📷.  

I work 4 days per week because I really believe in a strong life/work balance.
